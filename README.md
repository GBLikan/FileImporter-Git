# FileImporter-Git
This is a simple personal project intended for my personal use :
* first and foremost to learn some basic Python
* to import photos from my various devices into my centralized storage without creating duplicates all over the place (by implementing a rudimentary comparison between an "origin" and a "destination" folder, and copying files that were not found in a temporary location as per user input)
* and further down the line, to automatically sort by date (inferred from the filename if possible or from creation date otherwise) these files that were copied in the temporary location.
