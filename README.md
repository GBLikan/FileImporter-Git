# FileImporter-Git
This is a simple little project intended for my personal use :
* First and foremost to learn some basic Python.
* To import photos from my various devices into my centralized storage without creating duplicates all over the place (by implementing a rudimentary comparison between an "origin" and a "destination" folder, and by copying files that were not found in the destination folder to a temporary location as per user input, for examination).
* And further down the line, to automatically sort by date (inferred from the filename if possible or from creation date otherwise) these files that were prepped for examination.
